The purpose of this report is to analyze and explain the relationship between four forensic likelihood ratios for different ink samples. We are given three univariate likelihood ratios linking to the “X”,” Y”, and” Z” Which are measures of color which were created. The second component of the analysis is to an omnibus LR that (Dr. Saunders) created. We want to analyze the given data and figure out if there is a relationship between the marginal LR’s (LLR.x, LLR.y, and LLR.z) and the Omnibus LR, and explain the relationship if there any.
